# Dungeon Docs REST API

Dungeon Docs REST API is the backend developed for the Dungeon Docs application, an app for creating characters in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition SRD and joining groups.

## Installation

In your terminal, navigate to the directory you wish to clone into and run the line:

`git clone git@github.com:PhiferTristan/dungeonproject.git`

Once it has been cloned down, cd into that directory and run the line:

`pip install`

After the install is done, run this line for the virtual environment:

`pipenv shell`

Afterwards, open in VSCode and start your debugger. You may now run the client side and begin using the application.
