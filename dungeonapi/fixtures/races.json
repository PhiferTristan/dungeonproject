Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.    Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, w orn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.",

They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are m ore slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.  Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.",

Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harm less and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges o f wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.     Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brow n or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare am ong them and mustaches even m ore so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.    Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.",
